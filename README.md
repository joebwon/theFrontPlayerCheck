This just notifies a discord channel on player/join leaves.

I really wanted to see VAC bans so I'd know to look out for player's who had recent bans, and I thought it was cool to log player join/leaves.

Anyway I'm not going with this for now, but thought it'd be cool to share anyway, so enjoy if it's useful.

Vars you need to set are STEAM_API_KEY, DISCORD_WEBHOOK, and probably change log_file_path to suit.
